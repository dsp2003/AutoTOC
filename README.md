# AutoTOC
This is a forked version of standalone program to create the PCConsoleTOC.bin files for Mass Effect 3.

Unlike the original, it's compatible with all actual versions of Windows supported by the game itself, including Windows XP/2003, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10 (both 32 and 64-bit versions).

Fixed by Mr. Fry.

Run from the command line, just pass it the root ME3 folder (eg. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Mass Effect 3"), and it will generate a TOC for the base game and all DLCs.
